<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Here You can view, add and edit boards.</li>
    <li>You can define the layout of a board by adding or removing specific columns.</li>
    <li>Each column can have multiple sub-columns.</li>
    <li>You cannot remove a column from a board if there is at least one card currently in it.</li>
    <li>You must specify the column at which the development starts at, and the column at which development ends.</li>
    <li>Each project on the board has it's own lane.</li>
    <li>Work-in-progress property specifies how many cards can be in development simultaneously.</li>
    <li>If there are multiple projects on the board, the Work-in-progress property limits all of them.</li>
    <li>You can add a new card to the left-most column of the board, and move it towards the end of the board according to that card's development progress.</li>
    <li>When creating a card, you can select 'Silver bullet' as the card type, which signalizes that the card's realisation is urgent.</li>
    <li>There can only be one silver bullet card in development at the time.</li>
    <li>Card size is the estimated number of hours needed for that card's realisation.</li>
